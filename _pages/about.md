<!-- I am a YCAA Prize Fellow at the <a href='https://ycaa.yale.edu/'>Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>, where I work on various concepts in theoretical astrophysics. I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics and Astronomy from the <a href='https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/'>University of Pennsylvania</a>, along with a dual Master’s degree in Statistics from the <a href='https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/'>Wharton School</a>. Prior to Penn, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics (minor in Computer Science) at <a href='https://en.sharif.edu/'>Sharif University of Technology</a>.

My research spans a wide range of topics from cosmological scales (large scale structure and dark energy) to galactic scales (stellar dynamics and dark matter). I am an active member of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)

Energy in the Universe is distributed as roughly ~70% dark energy and ~30% dark matter. My research is split into dark energy-related and dark matter-related work with a similar distribution of focus!  -->

<!-- My research in cosmology is broadly focused on using the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe to constrain fundamental physics. The universe is a complicated place! Much of my research focuses on modeling cosmological observables using effective field theories in order to robustly extract signatures of fundamental physics from the sea of other cool stuff going on–exploding stars, active black holes at the centers of galaxies, etc. While most of my work has involved the clustering of galaxies–I am an active member of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument–this work has also taken me to other places, like the Lyman alpha forest. -->

<!-- with a focus on the evolution and dynamics of low-mass galaxies, globular clusters, dark matter, and studies of the low surface brightness universe.  -->

<!-- My work incorporates observational and theoretical evidence drawn from studies of galaxies and globular clusters to build a cohesive narrative of the nature of dark matter and its important interplay with the baryonic matter on small scales. -->

<!-- I like thinking about creative data-driven methods for exploring and discovering astrophysical objects and phenomena that were not known to us before. -->

I am a <a href='https://physics.yale.edu/opportunities/ycaa-prize-fellowship/'>YCAA Prize Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at the <a href='https://ycaa.yale.edu/'>Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>, working with <a href='https://physics.yale.edu/people/nikhil-padmanabhan'>Nikhil Padmanabhan</a> and <a href='http://www.astro.yale.edu/mgeha/'>Marla Geha</a>, and I am part of the <a href='https://www.desi.lbl.gov/'>Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a> collaboration. I recently received my Ph.D. from the <a href='https://www.physics.upenn.edu/'>University of Pennsylvania</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/ravi-sheth'>Ravi Sheth</a> and <a href='https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/robyn-sanderson'>Robyn Sanderson</a>, and concurrently obtained a dual Master’s degree in Statistics and Data Science from the <a href='https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/'>Wharton School</a>. Previously, I was a <a href='https://balzan.new.ox.ac.uk/'>Balzan Research Fellow</a> at the <a href='https://www.iap.fr/?langue=en'>Institut d’astrophysique de Paris (IAP)</a> and a Guest Researcher at the <a href='https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/'>Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA)</a>. Throughout my graduate studies, I was a recipient of the U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (<a href='https://www.nsfgrfp.org/'>NSF GRFP</a>). Prior to Penn, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science at <a href='https://en.sharif.ir/'>Sharif University of Technology</a>.

My research aims to <b>advance our understanding of fundamental physics</b> through an interdisciplinary approach that integrates <b>large-scale cosmological observations, theoretical physics,</b> and <b>advanced statistical and computational methods</b>. A significant portion of my work involves modeling the formation and evolution of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. Additionally, I investigate stellar dynamics and the structure of the Milky Way. Over the past few years, I have developed novel algorithms based on <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.251101'>optimal transport theory to reconstruct the initial conditions of galaxies observed in spectroscopic surveys</a>. These tools, tailored to address challenges in cosmology and astrophysics, enable us to trace the evolution of cosmic structures and reconstruct the initial density and displacement field of biased tracers, thereby improving constraints on cosmological parameters, such as those derived from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (see a feature in <a href='https://physics.yale.edu/news/yale-news-insights-and-outcomes-got-cosmic-milk'>Yale News</a>). Successful within the physics, computer science, and applied mathematics communities, these tools provide a foundation for understanding cosmic structure formation and evolution in astrophysical research. More broadly beyond astrophysics, my research involves interdisciplinary collaborations at the intersection of physics, nonlinear dynamics, and network science. In this context, I have developed physical models and statistical methods to explore the physics of <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/acec63'>higher-order interactions in complex systems</a>.

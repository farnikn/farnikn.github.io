<!-- I care deeply about mentoring, pedagogy, and public education, and I devote time to building community in a variety of ways. I serve as an elected representative on the Astronomy Student Council at Yale, and am a member of the Astronomy Climate and Diversity Committee. I am also a McDougal Graduate Teaching Fellow at the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning and a Graduate Affiliate at Ezra Stiles College. -->
